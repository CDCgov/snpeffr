# snpeffr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the snpeffr package is to filter and parse outputs generated by snpeffr for MDB/Fungi Net.
It depends on the R packages `data.table` and `R.utils`. If using the command line 
script included, you will also need the package `docopt`.


## Installation

You can install the development version of snpeffr like so:

``` r
# if remotes not installed, then install the pkg
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes") 

# install from zip location so no need for git
remotes::install_url("{Once Public}")   

```

## Example

You can test out the function on the example data provided:

```{r example}
library(snpeffr)

# path to example vcf included in package 
# replace with path to your vcf output if running on your own example
vcf_exe <- file.path(path.package("snpeffr"), "vcf-filter_ann_mod.vcf.gz")

# basic example
out <- snpeffr(vcf_path = vcf_exe)

head(out)

# to see function documentation/help for more details on the arguments and output
?snpeffr

```

## Command-line script

You can also use a command line version of this script at [inst/snpeffr.R](inst/snpeffr.R).

Download the file and from the directory where it's downloaded, run:

```
./snpeffr.R -f path_to_vcf

```

To get help and options for the command line version:

```
./snpeffr.R -h

```
Which will display the following help message:
```
Parse snpeff output to summary of mutations at positions of interest

Usage:
    snpeffr.r [--fpath=FPATH] [--pos=POS] [--genes=GENES] [-exc=EXCL] [-out=OUT]

Options:
    -v, --version           Show version.
    -f FPATH --fpath=FPATH  path to input vcf file from snpeff
    -p POS --pos=POS        format as named comma separated list
                            of positions (no spaces), i.e. see default
                            [default: fks1_hs1=221638:221665,fks1_hs2=223782:223805]
    -g GENES --genes=GENES  a list of comma separated gene names (no spaces) [default: CAB11_002014]
    -e EXCL --exc=EXCL      a quoted regular expression for effects to exclude [default: 'synonymous_variant']
    -o OUT --out=OUT        csv or gz file to save output to [default: out.csv]
    -h, --help              show this help text
```

To set it up to run from anywhere in your environment, add the path to your .bashrc file:

```
export PATH=$PATH:path/to/snpeffr.R
```

## Next steps

- Finalize output schema: 
  - keeping in the sequence of the mutation as well as the protein change?
  - filtering to ones that only have hgvs.p annotation or keeping all?
  - adding in column for putative impact per snpeff?
- Use [snpsift](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules/nf-core/snpsift) to do some of the upstream filtering (should be faster than reading in the
larger vcf using data.table, currently only the split command is a module, so we would
need to set up the filter command as a module if we wanted to use this.)
- Set up as a nextflow module that can be implemented downstream from the [snpeff module](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules/nf-core/snpeff) once it
is added to mycosnp-nf.
